# We are Elixirized: How We Develop Software

Our goal in this "Standards" content is to describe how we have agreed to (or are in the process of figuring out how to) do things, like document features, use git/GitHub, our evolving testing practices, etc.

Many firms have extensive "shop standards" written down ("shop" probably short for the workshops of decades past), and some have unwritten sets of "the way we do things." Worse yet, many development groups have nothing written down, instead relying on each person's interpretation of the folklore about how things "should" be done.

We don't want to be like that last extreme, and probably not as rigid as the first example.

Being Elixirized includes applying common sense, along with expecting to be wrong a fair amount.

We are using the GitHub [Wiki](https://github.com/Elixirized/elixirized-standards/wiki) functionality to document our "shop standards" thinking. We should (and hopefully will) update all of it as we evolve our thinking and actual practices.
